# Voice Notes WASM - Development Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for the Voice Notes WASM application, covering both Phase I (current implementation) and a high-level view of Phase II (future enhancements).

## Phase I: Voice Notes with Whisper WASM & Local Storage

**Timeline: 2 weeks**

### Week 1: Core Infrastructure & Recording Functionality

#### Days 1-2: Project Setup & Initial Components
- Set up Next.js project structure
- Install required dependencies
- Create basic UI layout
- Implement initial routing

#### Days 3-4: Whisper WASM Integration
- Integrate Whisper WASM library
- Implement WebGPU detection and fallback mechanism
- Create WhisperContext to replace DeepgramContext
- Set up audio recording and streaming to Whisper

#### Days 5-7: Transcription & Editor
- Implement real-time transcription display
- Integrate wscribe-editor for word-level editing
- Create animation for recording state
- Build recording controls UI with proper state management

### Week 2: Storage, Export & Refinement

#### Days 8-10: Dexie.js Integration & Note Management
- Set up IndexedDB schema with Dexie.js
- Implement CRUD operations for notes
- Create notes list view
- Build note detail view with editing capabilities

#### Days 11-12: Export Functionality
- Implement export to various formats (JSON, Text, HTML, Markdown)
- Create export UI
- Add file download capabilities

#### Days 13-14: Testing & Refinement
- Cross-browser testing
- Performance optimization
- UI/UX refinements
- Documentation updates

## Phase II: Podcaster/YouTuber TTS with Voice Cloning

**Timeline: Future Development (4-8 weeks)**

### Key Components

1. **Voice Profile Creation**
   - Voice sample collection interface
   - Voice model training integration
   - Voice profile management

2. **Enhanced Editor**
   - Timeline-based editing
   - Multi-track support
   - Sound effect integration
   - Background music capabilities

3. **Export Enhancements**
   - Direct podcast platform integration
   - YouTube upload capabilities
   - Custom audio format options
   - Batch processing

4. **Advanced TTS Features**
   - Emotion and tone control
   - Pronunciation customization
   - Voice style transfer
   - Multiple voice character support

### Technical Prerequisites for Phase II

- WebAssembly voice cloning model integration
- Enhanced audio processing pipeline
- Multi-track audio editing in browser
- Cloud synchronization options (optional)

## Dependencies

### Phase I Dependencies
- Next.js and React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Whisper WASM
- wscribe-editor
- Dexie.js
- Web Audio API

### Additional Phase II Dependencies
- Voice cloning model (TBD)
- Advanced audio processing libraries
- Media export APIs
- Potentially server components for heavier processing tasks

## Potential Challenges & Mitigation Strategies

### Phase I Challenges

1. **Whisper WASM Performance**
   - *Mitigation*: Implement progressive loading, WebGPU acceleration, and optimized model sizes

2. **Browser Compatibility**
   - *Mitigation*: Feature detection, graceful degradation, and clear user messaging

3. **Storage Limitations**
   - *Mitigation*: Implement data pruning strategies and export functionality for backup

### Phase II Challenges

1. **Voice Cloning Ethics & Quality**
   - *Mitigation*: Clear consent flows, watermarking, ethical usage guidelines

2. **Processing Requirements**
   - *Mitigation*: Optimize for WebGPU, consider optional cloud processing for heavy tasks

3. **Integration Complexity**
   - *Mitigation*: Modular architecture to allow incremental development and testing
